<h1 align="center"> The Little Sheep </h1>
I am creating websites with my caracters that I made. The Little Sheep - As Ovelhinhas -  is about my social project for children, where I teach arts and soft skills in a funny way. 
This especifc website I created using HTML, CSS e JavaSript, with JavaScript I learned more about Map and Advent Listener.
My project has two themes one light and another dark.
